## Get started


First, clone this repository:

Copy the file erode.sh from this new folder to the download folder.

Now change to the download folder and make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x erode.sh
```

Then issue the following command:

```bash
./erode.sh
```

## Update local repository


Change to ~/.erode/ and run:

git pull
```

That's it.
